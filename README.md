# Job Salary Analysis

## Introduction
Welcome to the Job Salary Analysis Project! This project aims to explore the relationship between years of experience and salary, considering different education levels. The core of this project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python 3
- **Libraries and Frameworks**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from [Kaggle's Salary Prediction Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrsimple07/salary-prediction-data/data). It includes features such as education level, years of experience, location, job title, age, gender, and salary. The dataset is synthetic and collected via simulation.

## Installation
To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that Python 3 and Jupyter Notebook are installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alfredh2/SalaryAnalysis.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the cloned repository.
4. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Notebook
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Open the `salary_analysis.ipynb` notebook.
4. Run the cells in the notebook to see the analysis and results.

## Results
The notebook includes a detailed analysis of the relationship between years of experience and salary, considering different education levels. We visualize and interpret how this relationship changes based on education.
